What is this?
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Who made this?
Ricardo L. Russ

Features:
A responsive dashboard made with bootstrap to ensure accessible mobile design. 
Allows for the user to search for their city, and upon recieving the query, the app will show
the temperature, humidity, wind-speed and UV index at the time the query is accessed. 
The app will also show a 5 day forecast, featuring icons for weather, temperature, and humidity
The app also includes functionality to save past searches in local storage and display them on a dropdown menu.


Known issues:
At the moment, too many api calls within a specific time period will eventually result in rejections that will therefore break the functionality of the site.
